used to see how neural network

can run it through our function approximation

use np.fft.fft (takes in discrete values)
- could pass in train_Y
- x - axis = frequency
- y - axis = amplitude

- play around with the optimizers for function approx
    - take note of which parameters work best for which optimization
        - learning rate, dimensions (architecture)
        - once done, ask Dr. Karniadakis for next steps (-> PINNs or deepO)

- read up on fourier transform, optimizers, why NN learns how it does
    - PINN (physics informed NN)
