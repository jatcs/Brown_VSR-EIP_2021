Week 1 (6/8/2021-6/14/2021)
- Assignment 1: use tf to take derivatives (automatic differentiation) [done]
[postponed]
- Assignment 2: make a deep O net to take derivatives
    - try to make it efficient
    - can use images

- Assignment 3: Learn Tensorboard (visualizer)
- Assignment 4: Train your deep O net to do something else

Week 2 (6/15/2021 - 6/21/2021)
- continue learning about deep O and tensorboard
- Assignment: function approximation (Dr. Karniadakis will send it)
    - learn fourier transform
        - useful to check if the NN is learning small frequencies

Week 3 (6/22/2021 - 6/28/2021)
- compare parameterization for different optimizers
  + learn about fourier transform (provides insight into which frequencies NNs learn first)
        - finding = low frequencies (higher energy / magnitude) are learned first = spectral bias


Week 4 (6/29/2021 - )
- scale up function approximation to use images for target function
    + use more than 1 input for the function (i.e. f(x,y))


Week 5
- start presentation
    - intro AI big topics (history), applications
    - our topic: interpretability - "wheres the magic -> how do these NN learn?"
        - use mathematics, take X-Ray of NN - see how NN learns
            - start w 1D example, finish with image processing example (2D)
- try the 2D transform on other images


Week 6
- train a DNN on png + compressed images
    - compare if accuracy post training is the same
        + number of iterations taken to reach desired accuracy
    - look in fourier domain
        - see if learning process occurs the same way each time
