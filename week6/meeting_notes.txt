features are localized in fourier domain

- can try biomed next week
can try taking images from eye aneurisms - from harvard med
    - eyes from people that have diabetes
        - their eyes are very red - red blood cells ballooning -> blindness
    - want to identify these features in the image
        - stagmentation, microaneurism


   - can also try on sickle cell data
        - see misshaped (sickle) blood cells
        - can look at fourier signatures that these features leave
        (look at these images in fourier domain)


- image compression (1st)
    - try to learn on full features + compressed features
    - contrast original + compressed fourier signatures

    - compare how much faster net learns compressed vs original
    - compression is basically removing high frequencies in fourier domain
    - image -> compress at certain ratio (i.e. 5:1)
                -> compress at different ratios to compare if net can still learn small features (compare reconstructed image)
                    - keep track of loss + how fast networks can work on different compression ratios


focus: x-ray on 1D, 2D, see what features are learned
    -> how use?
        -> represent image with fourier transform
            - more localized
            - can see what features are present in an image
                (like decompose music into its notes)
            - once done approx in fourier space, ifft -> get og format
                - can compute loss in fourier domain or original (use ifft to get it back)
            - NN can learn features in fourier space
                - maybe faster
                - see what features are learned


- keep track of loss, take xray on more steps
- original domain -> fft -> fourier domain
    - can do reverse to get approx in original domain
